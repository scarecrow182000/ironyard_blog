<p>So in my last entry I ended it with the question of how glamorous is the process
of learning code 5 days a week, 8 hours a day, for 12 weeks.  Haha. This journey
of learning just starts with class, in which you will be bombarded with all kinds
of information you will struggle to write down, or type into notes, or cram into
your memory. After class is your lab time. After lab time is getting home and working
more on your homework. All these new concepts will be rattling around in your head
fighting for space with the concepts you just learned yesterday and the day before
yesterday. You will delve into insanely dry reference books, root around for demo
videos, and dig up obscure web references in hurculanean efforts to understand
what amounts to a new language that humans are only supposed to just comprehend,
but which absolutely sings to your computer. It's frustrating and challenging and
exhausting. But, the moments when realization dawns on you that you can comprehend
and write in a new machine language provide quite a bit of satisfaction (usually
into the night).
