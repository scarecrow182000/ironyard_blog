<p>Before anything else I want to let you know, I love computers, but the last 15 years
of my life, I've been working as a cook/chef. It's not a career choice that is as
glamorous as movies, TV shows, and Culinary School commercials like to make out.
The hours are long, you work when everyone else is playing, the work is backbreaking,
the pay sucks, and you are constantly exposed to open flames and sharp cutting
surfaces. After a decade you will end up with flat feet, hands and arms loaded with
scars, and a social circle that will most likely include exclusively the people
with whom you work. The other thing you should know about me is that I have a
beautiful 16 month old daughter whom I want to spend more time with. When I heard
the Iron Yard commercials on the radio, it was too good to be true, but I decided
what else did I have to lose so I committed myslef to it. Twelve weeks of nothing
but learning code Monday-Friday, 8 hours a day. Sounds exciting and glamorous right?
